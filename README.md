# Module-2-Challege_Stocks-Analysis
This is a refactored code, where I created arrays for tickers, volume, starting and ending prices, and also used only one for loop to go through the stocks data we have and calculate total volumes and return per ticker.  This should speed the compilation time and save more space in the memory.

According to the stocks return it seems that ENPH and RUN are one of the best stocks to invest in since they have a % of return more than 80%. While DQ and JKS are one of the worst stocks to invest in.
